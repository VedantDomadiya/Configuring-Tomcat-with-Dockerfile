# Install Tomcat through Docker

This repository provides instructions and a Dockerfile for setting up and running Apache Tomcat using Docker.  

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). It implements the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications, providing a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code.

## Steps to Set Up Apache Tomcat with Docker

### A) Setting Up the Directory  
- Create a working directory to store the Dockerfile and other related files.  

### B) Creating and Configuring the Dockerfile  
- Write a Dockerfile to pull the base image and configure Apache Tomcat for your environment.  

### C) Building the Docker Image  
- Use the Dockerfile to build a Docker image with:  
  ```bash
  docker build -t tomcat-image .
  ```

### D) Running the Docker Container  
- Run the Docker container from the built Tomcat image:  
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name tomcat-container tomcat-image
  ```
- Access Tomcat on your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

### E) Rectifying Errors  
- If you encounter errors, copy all files from `webapps.dist` to `webapps` within the Tomcat container to fix them:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it tomcat-container bash
  cp -r /usr/local/tomcat/webapps.dist/* /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
  ```
- Refresh your browser or navigate to `http://localhost:8080` again.
